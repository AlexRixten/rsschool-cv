### Briefly About Myself:
I started my journey into the frontend world as a tester. But the bosses at my company noticed my love of programming and offered me to take a frontend developer course. After 3 months I completed the course and made about 30 different templates. Then in just 2 months I took a course in js and a month later I became a frontend developer
After a couple of months, I mastered react and then react native. At the same time, I was working on 4-5 projects at once. It was both vanilla js and react and react native.

In this company I was both a manager and a layout designer and even a team leader for several months.

I am currently working in another company, where I get a lot of pleasure from work and a huge amount of new experience.

### Code example:
It was the task [7kyu Descending Order](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5467e4d82edf8bbf40000155) from Codewars <br>
#### Description
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

#### Examples

|      Input      |     Output      |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|
|   ```42145```   |   ```54421```   |
|  ```145263```   |  ```654321```   |
| ```123456789``` | ```987654321``` |

#### My solution
```
function XO(str) {
    let arr = [];
    let countX = 0
    let countO = 0;
    arr = str.toLowerCase().split('');
    for(let i = 0; i <= str.length - 1; i++) {
        if(arr[i] === 'x') {
            countX++;
        } else if (arr[i] === 'o') {
            countO++;
        }
    }
    return countX === countO;
}
```
